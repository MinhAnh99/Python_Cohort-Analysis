# Python_Cohort_Analysis
## I. Introduction
### About Cohort Analysis
-  Cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic over a certain period of time. A cohort analysis table is used to visually show cohort data in order for analysts compare different groups of users at the same time in their lifecycle and see the long-term connection between the characteristics of a given user group.
-  Using cohort analysis to understand the trends and patterns of customers over time and to tailor their offers of products and services to the identified cohorts.

###  Types of Cohorts to Analyze
- Time Cohorts: customers who signed up for a product or service during a particular time frame. Analyzing these cohorts shows the customers’ behavior depending on the time they started using a company’s products or services. The time may be monthly or quarterly, depending on the sales cycle of a company.
-  Segment Cohorts: customers who purchased a specific product or paid for a specific service in the past. It groups customers by the type of product or level of service they signed up for. Customers who signed up for basic level services might have different needs than those who signed up for advanced services. Understanding the needs of the various cohorts can help a company design tailor-made services or products for particular segments
-  Size Cohorts: refer to the various sizes of customers who purchase a company’s products or services. The customers may be small and startup businesses, middle-sized businesses, and enterprise-level businesses.

###  Business Case Study in this project
Using Python to analyze KPMG transaction data and create a cohort that allows stakeholders to evaluate user engagement beginning with their first transaction.


- This project focuses on performing Cohort Analysis based on Time.
- Customers will be assigned to purchase cohorts based on the month of their first purchase (cohort month).
- The cohort index gets assigned to each of the customer's purchases, showing the number of months from the first transaction.

## II. Data Visualization with Python

## III. Insights
- KPMG's year-to-date retention rate is pretty good, 30% or more.
- Customers who place orders at the beginning of January, February and March are stability (around 33% to 43.8%) 
- From mid-year: April July tend to order stable, and relatively higher than the rest months of the year.
- After 5 months of operation, customers who registered and placed their first order in July 2017 have a strong retention rate (up to 48.1%).

## IV. Recommendations
- With the goal to increase the retention over the months, there should be attractive specials for customers in the first few months of the year.
- Mid-year months have higher retention rates than other months, need to find out reasons with related data and visualization of other data to apply to the remaining months of the year.
